# LeetCode Practice Repository

A structured repository for solving and mastering LeetCode problems through **spaced repetition** and **deep concept analysis**.

## 📚 Purpose

This repository serves as a personal learning system for:
- Solving LeetCode problems systematically
- Applying spaced repetition to reinforce understanding
- Analyzing core Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) concepts
- Tracking progress across multiple attempts
- Building muscle memory for common patterns

## 🏗️ Repository Structure

The repository follows a three-level hierarchy:

```
Concept > Problem > TimeDone
```

### 1️⃣ Concept Level
Top-level folders organized by DSA topics:
- `Arrays&Hashing/` - Array manipulation and hash-based problems
- `TwoPointer/` - Two-pointer technique problems
- _(More concepts added as you progress)_

### 2️⃣ Problem Level
Each concept contains folders for specific LeetCode problems:
- `TwoSum/`
- `ValidPalindrome/`
- `GroupAnagrams/`
- etc.

### 3️⃣ TimeDone Level (Spaced Repetition)
Each problem folder contains attempt folders tracking spaced repetition:
- `firstRun/` - Initial attempt
- `secondRun/` - Second attempt (after time interval)
- `thirdRun/` - Third attempt
- `fourthRun/` - Fourth attempt
- _(and so on...)_

## 🔄 Spaced Repetition Methodology

This repository implements spaced repetition to move solutions from short-term to long-term memory:

1. **First Run**: Solve the problem for the first time, understanding the approach
2. **Second Run**: Revisit after a few days/weeks, solve without looking at previous solution
3. **Third Run**: Solve again after a longer interval to reinforce the pattern
4. **Fourth+ Runs**: Continue until the solution becomes intuitive


## 💡 Learning Benefits

- **Pattern Recognition**: Repeatedly solving similar problems builds pattern recognition
- **Concept Mastery**: Multiple attempts deepen understanding of underlying concepts
- **Progress Tracking**: Clear visibility of how many times a problem has been revisited
- **Approach Evolution**: Compare different approaches across runs to identify optimal solutions
- **Interview Preparation**: Spaced repetition ensures long-term retention for technical interviews

## 📁 Example Structure

```
TwoPointer/
  └── ValidPalindrome/
      └── firstRun/
          ├── valid_palindrome.py
          └── valid_palindrome_improvement.py
  └── TwoSum2-InputArrayIsSorted/
      └── firstRun/
          └── twoSum2InputArrayIsSorted.py
```

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

1. **Choose a Concept**: Start with a DSA concept folder (e.g., `Arrays&Hashing/`)
2. **Select a Problem**: Pick a problem you want to solve
3. **First Attempt**: Create a `firstRun/` folder and implement your solution
4. **Analyze**: Document time/space complexity and the approach used
5. **Space It Out**: Return to the problem after days/weeks for subsequent runs
6. **Compare**: Review previous solutions to see improvement and pattern internalization



**Note**: This is a living repository that evolves with your learning journey. Each run represents not just repetition, but growth in problem-solving intuition and DSA mastery.
